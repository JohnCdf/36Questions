36 questions
=
This is based off of the study by Arthur Aron, in which he claims that these 36 questions can induce inter-personal closeness between people.

This application aims to match strangers and put them up to the 36 questions that lead to love, ideally ending up with a connection.

The technologies used are:
* React
* Node.js / Express
* Socket.io
* Axios
* MongoDB / Mongoose

*The main app has been developed on mobile on [this](https://github.com/SKEPDIMI/36questions-mobile) repository!*
This repository will mainly focus on the API rather than the front end.
